# Start-up/Entrepreneur website
#### `The goal of this project` is to deliver a functional prototype that will eventually serve as a host of agrigated information for students interested in start-ups and entrepreneurship. The site will serve to help students learn more what it takes to sustain a successful start-up. The main deliverable will essentially be a functional full-stack prototype. The prototype will have a front and back-end both connected via a pipeline that can later be utilized for future development such as making each user experience unique. The prototype also essentially sets up the overall design of the site. 
The front page will  allow students to sign-in creating a more dynamic experience via the back-end which will track what student have completed in terms of modules. The site should also list the modules uncompleted in an organized fashion by the specific user ensuring the site functions in a way that benefits the user. 
Students will be able to like modules and also view videos and articles that pertain to the specific module to create a more diverse pool of information.
Students will be able to access other modules and resources via the modules and resource pages.
